EPANET-Matlab-Class
===================

The `EPANET-Matlab Class` is an open-source software which operates within the Matlab environment, for providing a programming interface for the latest version of [EPANET](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet), a hydraulic and quality modelling software created by the US EPA, with Matlab, a  high-level technical computing software. The goal of the Matlab Class is to serve as a common programming framework for research and development in the growing field of smart water networks.

The `EPANET-Matlab Class` features easy to use commands/wrappers for viewing, modifying, simulating and plotting results produced by the EPANET libraries.  

# Requirements #
* [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/)
* [EPANET](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet) The OpenWaterAnalytics (OWA) EPANET version is recommented instead of the one provided by the EPA.gov website, as a number of bugs have been fixed in the OWA version. 

# How to use the class #

Download the folder `Download ZIP`, set the run path in Matlab within the saved folder, and run `TEST.m`. This will execute all the commands which have been inmplemented in the Class.

# How to fix/report bugs #

To fix a bug `Fork` the `EPANET-Matlab Class`, `Edit` the code and make the appropriate change, and the `Pull` it so that we evaluate it. 

Also please note that some bugs may exist in the original `EPANET` files.
